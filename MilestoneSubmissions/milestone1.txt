# CSCI-3308-Project-Repository
Project Overview
Your application must have a GUI, a database, API data source(optional), a middle layer connecting your UI to your data. The code should be built within Docker containers so they are portable. Make sure to consider these core requirements when designing the architecture of your application. You are required to use the technology stack that you have learned in this course. Refer to the project guide for detailed expectations. If you would like clarifications, please ask your instructor/TA.

7. Version Control
info
You are required to create a public GitHub repository and add all the members of the team to it. Share the link to this repository in this document.
This repository should have the following folders:
TeamMeetingLogs - The minutes of the meeting with your TA every week will be recorded in a file here. You will be updating the same file every week with the latest updates. Points to include in the minutes would be:
Decisions made
Alternative actions/options discussed
Follow-up items, including agreed-on roles and responsibilities
MilestoneSubmissions - All course-related documents, including this one, will be stored in this folder.
ProjectSourceCode - The source code and all relevant project documentation for the application will be stored in this folder.
ReadMe.md - Refer to the project guide for more information on this.
For a detailed view of your repository, refer to the project guide
.gitignore - Please remember to create a .gitignore file in your "ProjectSourceCode" folder in the repository
8. Development Methodology
Since this project is scheduled for 4 weeks, we encourage you to use an Agile Methodology. You can also use a hybrid set of practices from different methodologies. For example, you can use Scrum meetings and Kanban boards to track the progress of your project. The important thing is to have a plan and stick to it.
9. Communication Plan
Describe in a sentence or two how your team plans to communicate with each other during the course of the project. You must identify a collaboration tool for team members to utilize for coordination of their work and communication among team members and with the TA. Some tools you could use: MS Teams, Slack, Discord, Google Groups, etc. Please refrain from using IMs for the purposes of this project.
tip
You can track communication for project development tasks as comments on the user story issues you create on the GitHub project board. That will help you remain organized.
10. Meeting Plan
Team Meeting: Identify the day(s) and time(s), mode, and location your team has agreed upon for regular meetings. “Modality” refers to how you are meeting (face-to-face), group video chat (like Zoom, Google Meet), etc.
Weekly meeting with TA: You will also mention the meeting day, time and location (physical or online) for the weekly meeting with your TA here.
Please refer to these instructions for expectations in your weekly meeting with your TAs. Do read the entire section carefully.
11. Use Case Diagram
