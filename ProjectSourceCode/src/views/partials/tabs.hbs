      One of the hardest aspects is reaching out to professionals to get their insights, recommendations, and asking for their time and referrals. In this document, we’ll provide you with the general outreach format and explain how to follow up.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <strong>Format 1: Already Applied</strong>
    <br>
    <p>
    Hello [blank],
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>I’m applying for this internship and I think I’d be a good fit for x & y reasons.
        I would love to have a conversation with you to demonstrate this and if you think I’m a good fit, I’d love to get a referral.
        Do you have 15-20 minutes to connect?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <strong>Format 2: Seeking Information</strong>
    <br>
    <p>
      Hello [blank],
      <ul class="indent">
        <li>I’m a [enter your educational or experience background] and I’m interested in your firm. I would love to connect to learn more about what you do and about ___[maybe department structure].
        Would you happen to have 15-20 minutes to connect?
        <br>
        Some potential times could be:
        <ul class="indent">
          <li>Time 1, time zone, date, location</li>
          <li>Time 1, time zone, date, location</li>
        </ul>
        If not, I’ve provided my [Auto Scheduler] to help with scheduling!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      These are two really strong options when it comes to cold outreach. However, not all people will respond to this. In fact, most people will take several times to do cold outreach. So make sure that you have a reminder on when to keep reaching out to them!
